# Project Title

This is विद्याARर्थी app.

An interactive AR/VR enabled education app that aims to help students of all age groups in their studies by enhancing their visualization power.



## How to use?
Download the apk from the repository and also download the image target. You can use either a hard copy of the image target to augment the objects or else you can simply open the image target in full screen on any phone and see the objects augment over it.

For now we have only one image target for all the subjects but in practical use, we will have entire textbooks with several pages where each model can be set to augment on a particular page of the book.
